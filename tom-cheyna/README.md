# Project Name

**Author**: Tom North and Cheyna Humphries
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
A blog that users can find more information.  If they select from any of the dropdowns it will display only that selected one.  If the user selects the read on it should display the rest of the article.

## Getting Started
Install all the technologies that we used. Under js, Jquery, CSS, Html, and how these technologies interact with each other. Open VS Code. Use object constructors to create objects. Use Jquery to append the objects properties to the DOM.

## Architecture
jQuery, JS, CSS HTML, VSCODE, ICOMOON, MIT LICENSE
