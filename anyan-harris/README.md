## Overview
This is a blog application that sorts the blogs stored in blogArticles.js, and displays them in "most recent" order. It also adds a filtering solution, which is goverernated by articleView.js.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo into your directory, and use live-server (or whatever server you prefer) to run the index.html. This should be sufficient to run the application.

## Architecture
This app uses the following libraries and solutions:
* Normalize.css: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
* jQuery: https://jquery.com/ 
* IcoMoon Fonts: IcoMoon.io
